I am Leonardo Salicari, I was born in [Perugia, Umbria, Italy](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/43.1124/12.3885) and now I am currently in Padova, Veneto, Italy pursuing my Ph.D. in Physics. Specifically, I work in the statistical mechanics field with a strong bias towards computational and theoretical biophyics (some say that [I like proteins](https://youtu.be/L2QSMzeSvxk?si=EflSKtiOXzwWEJ2a)).

If you are interested in my academic carrier you might want to check out the [publication page](publications).

I love to play board games, hiking through and to cool places (from seashores to mountains) and recently took up a [Nikon D3300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3300) with an 18-55 mm lens and began taking photos of what seems nice.
